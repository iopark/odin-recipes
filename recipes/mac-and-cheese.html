    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/mac-and-cheese.jpg" alt="Mac and Cheese.jpg">
    <p>This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. 
        It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, 
        resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles.</p>
