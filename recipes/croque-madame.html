    <h1>Croque Madame</h1>
    <img src="../images/Croque Madame.jpg" alt="Croque Madame">
    <p>A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch dish. Once you try this, 
        it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese sandwich again. Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, 
        this deserves the real thing! Using Gruy√®re cheese will make all the difference.</p>
